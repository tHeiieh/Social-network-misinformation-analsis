        "*   The `SimpleGCN` model was successfully modified to include a `torch.nn.Dropout` layer after the first `ReLU` activation for regularization.\n",
        "*   The model was trained with the following hyperparameters: a learning rate of 0.01, 16 hidden dimensions, 200 training epochs, and a dropout rate of 0.5.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current GCN model, even with initial hyperparameter tuning and dropout, requires further optimization to meet the 80% accuracy target on the Cora dataset.\n",
        "*   A more systematic and extensive hyperparameter search (e.g., using Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization) and exploring alternative GNN architectures like Graph Attention Networks (GAT) or GraphSAGE are crucial next steps for performance improvement.\n"
